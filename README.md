# Three Partition Solver (Java)
Algorithm created and implemented by me.
A function to check if a list of 3n size of numbers can be partitioned into a list of n triples such that the sum of each triple was the same. This program can handle a list of size 84 before throwing overflow errors due to the factorial nature of the problem. A simpler but brute force solution exists in Python using intertools, however I created a custom solution in Java without using an intertools equivalent.

# WordIndexer (Python)
Python program that builds an index of one or more files, and then lets the user interactively query the index to look up the occurrences of words, print out a particular occurrence, or output the entire index.

# Make Optimal Change (Java)
When given any amount and denominations, find the most optimal way for making the given amount using the given denominations. When no such way exists, IMPOSSIBLE is returned.

# Base Converter (Java)
This program converts a given number from one base to another.

# Binary Tree (Java)
No imports, only first principles. A data structure of objects within nodes in which each node in the tree can have up to two children nodes. My binary tree implements Iterable and iterates in preorder.

# Madlibs (x86-Assembly & C)
Arguments are processed in assembly and piped to the C file to compute. This program will take arguments and insert them into the given statement at its index number. This program supports up to 10 arguments to madlib (digits 0-9) and if the argmument length does not reach a given number then the number is unchanged.
