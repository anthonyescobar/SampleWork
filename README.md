# Base Converter
This program converts a given number from one base to another.

# Binary Tree
No imports, only first principles. A data structure of objects within nodes in which each node in the tree can have up to two children nodes. My binary tree implements Iterable and iterates in preorder.

# Make Optimal Change
When given any amount and denominations, find the most optimal way for making the given amount using the given denominations. When no such way exists, IMPOSSIBLE is returned.

# Numbered List
No imports, only first principles. A data structure for longs to be put into a custom list with more adaptability than a typical array.

# Three Partition Solver
Algorithm created and implemented by me.
A function to check if a list of 3n size of numbers can be partitioned into a list of n triples such that the sum of each triple was the same. This program can handle a list of size 84 before throwing overflow errors due to the factorial nature of the problem. A simpler but brute force solution exists in Python using intertools, however I created a custom solution in Java without using an intertools equivalent.
